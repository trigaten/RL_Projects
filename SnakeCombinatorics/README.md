# Tabular-Q-Learning_In_Snake
Finds optimal policies for a given square game board.

--Run displayTest and change the line GAME_SIZE = to whatever boardsize you would like. Boardsizes > 3 will essentially not 
compute because state spaces explode according to the following table (Actual section):

Possible states at a given board length, L

L | Upper Bound | Actual

1 : 1 | 1

2 : 236 | 44

3 : 137700 | 2080

4 : 535692272 | 143920
